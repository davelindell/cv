  abstract={
    Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) are probabilistic inference machines that admit
    exact inference in linear time in the size of the network. Existing
    parameter learning approaches for SPNs are largely based on the maximum
    likelihood principle and hence are subject to overfitting compared to
    more Bayesian approaches. Exact Bayesian posterior inference for SPNs is
    computationally intractable. Both standard variational inference and
    posterior sampling for SPNs are computationally infeasible even for
    networks of moderate size due to the large number of local latent
    variables per instance. In this work, we propose a novel deterministic
    collapsed variational inference algorithm for SPNs that is
    computationally efficient, easy to implement and at the same time allows
    us to incorporate prior information into the optimization formulation.
    Extensive experiments show a significant improvement in accuracy compared
    with a maximum likelihood based approach.

  abstract={
    The widespread adoption and contextually sensitive
    nature of smartphone devices has increased concerns over smartphone
    malware. Machine learning classifiers are a current method
    for detecting malicious applications on smartphone systems. This
    paper presents the evaluation of a number of existing classifiers,
    using a dataset containing thousands of real (i.e. not synthetic)
    applications. We also present our STREAM framework, which
    was developed to enable rapid large-scale validation of mobile
    malware machine learning classifiers.
